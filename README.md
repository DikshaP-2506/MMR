## Setup and Installation Instructions

To set up and run MapMyRoute locally, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone <repository_url>
    cd MapMyRoute
    ```
2. **Frontend Setup (React with Vite):**
    ```bash
    cd frontend
    npm install
    npm run dev
    ```
    (Adjust commands based on your actual project structure and package manager.)
3. **Backend Setup (FastAPI with Python):**
    ```bash
    cd backend
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    uvicorn main:app --reload
    ```
    (Adjust commands based on your actual project structure. Ensure you have Python and pip installed.)
4. **Database Configuration (PostgreSQL):**
    - Ensure PostgreSQL is installed and running.
    - Create a database for MapMyRoute.
    - Update the database connection string in your backend configuration (e.g., in a `.env` file).
5. **Environment Variables (.env File Structure):**
    - You will need to create `.env` files for the backend to securely store your API keys and configuration values.

    **Create a .env file in backend folder(.env):**
    ```
    # Database
    DATABASE_URL=postgresql://<username>:<password>@localhost:5432/<database_name>

    # Adzuna API
    ADZUNA_APP_ID=your_adzuna_app_id
    ADZUNA_APP_KEY=your_adzuna_app_key

    # Groq API
    GROQ_API_KEY=your_groq_api_key
    ```
    Be sure to add your `.env` files to `.gitignore` to keep your secrets safe!

    **Create a .env file in frontend folder (frontend/.env):**
    ```
    VITE_API_URL=https://mapmyroute.onrender.com
    ```
    In your React code, access it with:
    ```js
    const apiUrl = import.meta.env.VITE_API_URL;
    ```
    **Note:** After changing the `.env` file, restart your dev server (`npm run dev`).
6. **Firebase Authentication Setup:**
    - Create a Firebase project and enable Authentication.
    - Configure your Firebase credentials in your frontend application in firebase.js file.
    - **Important:** Add your deployed frontend domain (e.g., `your-app.vercel.app`) to the list of authorized domains in the Firebase Console under Authentication â†’ Sign-in method. This is required for Google login to work in production.
